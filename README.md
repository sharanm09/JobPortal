Job Portal – End-to-End Business Flow (Presentation Draft)

Overview
This platform streamlines the recruitment lifecycle by orchestrating a single, continuous flow: recruiters publish a role, the system distributes it broadly, relevant candidates are sourced and organized, resumes are centralized and interpreted, candidates are scored against the role, screening and assessments validate fit, documents are collected and verified, interviews progress through structured rounds, and hiring decisions are finalized with clear communication. This README explains that flow in clear business terms (no code, no APIs) so stakeholders can align quickly on how the experience works from start to finish.


Roles & Responsibilities
- Recruiter: Creates jobs, sources candidates, screens, coordinates interviews, verifies docs, finalizes offers.
- Hiring Manager: Reviews shortlisted candidates, interviews, provides feedback, signs off on final decision.
- Interviewers: Conduct rounds, submit structured feedback, and recommend decisions.
- Admin/Operations: Oversees governance, SLAs, compliance, and reporting.

JD Attributes (What We Capture from Job Descriptions)
- Job title, company name, location, employment type, work mode.
- Experience range, salary/CTC range, skills required.
- Role description, responsibilities, must‑haves vs good‑to‑haves.
- Education/certifications, benefits, application instructions/deadline, contact info.

Resume Attributes (What We Capture from Resumes)
- Personal: name, email, phone, address, LinkedIn/portfolio (if present).
- Professional: current designation/company, current & expected CTC, notice period, total experience, domain/management exposure.
- Skills: technical, domain, soft skills; proficiency levels; certifications; languages.
- Experience: companies, roles, durations, responsibilities, achievements, technologies, team size, reporting lines, reasons for change (if stated).
- Education: degrees, institutions, year(s), specialization, academic projects/achievements.
- Additional: projects, publications, awards, volunteer work, references, work authorization, availability.

Candidate Progression Logic (At‑a‑Glance)
- New → Sourced/Applied → Parsed & Scored → Screened → Assessment → Interview Round(s) → Verified → Shortlisted → Offer → Accepted/Declined → Onboarding
