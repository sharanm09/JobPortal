Job Portal – End-to-End Business Flow (Presentation Draft)

Overview
This platform streamlines the recruitment lifecycle by orchestrating a single, continuous flow: recruiters publish a role, the system distributes it broadly, relevant candidates are sourced and organized, resumes are centralized and interpreted, candidates are scored against the role, screening and assessments validate fit, documents are collected and verified, interviews progress through structured rounds, and hiring decisions are finalized with clear communication. This README explains that flow in clear business terms (no code, no APIs) so stakeholders can align quickly on how the experience works from start to finish.

How the Flow Works (Narrative)
1) A recruiter creates a job post with key details (title, skills, experience, location, CTC range, employment type, responsibilities, apply link). As soon as it’s saved, the system prepares the content for distribution and pushes it across chosen channels (social and job boards). The recruiter gets a confirmation and can track live status.
2) As the job goes live, the platform starts sourcing. Recruiters can search manually by skill, experience, CTC, and location, while the system simultaneously discovers profiles from external sources. All prospective profiles are normalized into a single “candidate pool,” deduplicated, and enriched.
3) Resumes arrive from multiple sources (direct applies, recruiter uploads, email, referrals, social). The system stores files securely and tracks metadata (who, what, when, source). Each resume is processed to extract structured attributes (skills, experience, education, projects) to make searching and comparison effortless.
4) For each job, the system maps JD attributes to resume attributes and produces a match score using weighted criteria (skills, experience, CTC alignment, location, education). Recruiters see ranked lists to focus on the most relevant candidates first.
5) Recruiters then run a quick screening: verify basics (experience, current role, notice period, CTC), confirm interest, and capture remarks. Candidates that pass are invited to assessments tailored to the job’s competencies.
6) Assessments (technical/functional/aptitude/communication) are scheduled and auto-evaluated wherever possible. Results are recorded and surfaced alongside match scores and screening notes for a complete view.
7) Candidates upload required documents (ID, education, experience letters, payslips). The system organizes and tracks verification status so recruiters know exactly what’s pending and what’s verified.
8) Interviews progress through structured rounds (technical, functional, managerial/HR, client). Scheduling, reminders, feedback, and decisions are centralized so every stakeholder stays aligned. Candidates who pass move forward automatically to the next round.
9) Final shortlisting consolidates scores, feedback, verification status, and availability into a single decision. Offers are prepared, acceptance is tracked, and onboarding prep starts. Candidates who aren’t selected receive considerate communications. All outcomes feed analytics for continuous improvement.
